# Interstitial Engineering

This directory is a living archive of my technical notes and reference materials focused on **light interstitial elements**—boron (B), carbon (C), nitrogen (N), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O)—and their impact on the mechanical and chemical behavior of structural materials.

These notes are part of my PhD research in computational materials science and explore how interstitials influence:

- **Mechanical properties** — including dislocation motion, creep resistance, solid-solution strengthening, and phase stability.
- **Surface protection** — including oxidation, scale formation, and segregation at grain boundaries and interfaces.
- **Diffusion kinetics and thermodynamics** — including vacancy-mediated pathways and interstitial flux behavior.

The aim of this archive is to support deeper understanding of **interstitial-mediated alloy design**, with relevance to high-temperature performance, corrosion resistance, and advanced structural applications.
