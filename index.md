## Research

I am passionate about advancing the understanding of structural materials, compositionally complex alloy systems, and the role of light interstitial engineering in enhancing their performance.  
My work seeks to expand the fundamental knowledge of superalloy systems, oxidation and corrosion resistance, and defect behavior in extreme environments.

My research philosophy is grounded in bridging the gap between fundamental science and real-world application.  
I am deeply motivated by the belief that academic findings must not only uncover new mechanisms, but also be scalable and realizable to meet the evolving demands of industrial and defense operations.  
My work integrates atomistic simulations with experimental validation to ensure that discoveries in materials behavior can translate into tangible, operational improvements for tomorrow’s most challenging environments — from advanced energy systems to next-generation aerospace and warfare applications.

## Blog and Essays

I occasionally share essays and reflections on mentorship, leadership, materials science, and the intersection between academia, industry, and defense applications.  
These writings aim to connect technical innovation with the human and organizational elements necessary to bring discoveries into real-world impact.
